## The Dataset and Problem:
We wanted to take a crack at the statistics provided by MLB in all their years of baseball. With this knowledge, we wanted to see how we could manipulate the data in a way that could be advantageous in predicting future matches.
We wanted to be able to get a strong sense of how likely teams were in hitting a home run. We wanted to use data such home runs, bases on balls/walks, and total bases.
We wanted to use the data that we deemed best suited to compare with the number of home runs, because it would give us a good idea of what kind of players the teams had.
## Phase 1 and 2 Contributions
In Phase 1, we began by obtaining the datasets from the MLB website of all the years available. We used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data and combined it into a single dataframe.
We then took it to Phase 2, with cleaning up the data; dropping columns we did not need. We also added in the visualizations needed for the project,
including scatterplots, box plots, and a parallel coordinates plot. 
Our histogram provides us with an evenly distributed bell-curve for the data on homeruns, with only a few outliers. 
And team data shows many more outliers in catagories like doubles, triples, and RBI's. 
It was interesting to find that there was almost no correlation between the team avg age and the number of homeruns hit.
